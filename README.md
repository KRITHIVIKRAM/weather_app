<br>
This project is a weather application that allows users to search for current weather conditions in any city. The user inputs a city name, and the app fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, displaying temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The interface features a modern, responsive design with smooth transitions and error handling for invalid city names. Weather conditions are visually represented with corresponding icons for clear, cloudy, rainy, drizzle, and misty weather. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a seamless user experience.
